/// The `--share-ngram-table` link path.
///
/// The table is 102 GB and byte-identical in every quantization, so a second
/// install hardlinks it instead of copying it. What that has to get right is
/// small and easy to get wrong in a way nothing notices: one inode with two
/// links, an empty origin refused rather than shared, an existing destination
/// replaced rather than linked over, and an optional file that is simply
/// absent when the snapshot does not carry one.
///
/// The whole-repack path needs a `qwen38flash` snapshot to reach this code, and
/// this does not: the decision being pinned is the link itself.
