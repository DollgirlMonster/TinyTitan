/// What `memory_search` returns, and why.
///
/// The measured weakness was a *common* word winning: a question naming "town"
/// scored 3 against `setting/town`'s key while the rain rule's value scored 1,
/// so the town came first on a question about rain. These pin the fix — a term
/// weighted by its inverse document frequency over the candidates, and a value
/// match worth two rather than one — and the ordering it must not change.
///
/// `benchmark/side_engine_recall.py --baseline` mirrors this scorer and measures
/// it: the ten questions phrased in the store's own words stay at 10 of 10, and
/// the authored paraphrases go from 1 of 4 to 3 of 4 at rank 1. The one that
/// remains needs a word the fact does not contain at all ("boat" against a
/// ferry rule), which no term weighting reaches.
