# Give every installed GPU-path model the ANE sidecar it needs, and verify it.
#
# A model without a sidecar has no ANE prefill at all: the switch is on by
# default, the runtime asks for the sidecar, and finds nothing — which is how
# the dense Qwen 3.5 family spent its whole life on the GPU with the feature
# apparently enabled. So the sidecar is part of installing a model, not an
# experiment to remember afterwards.
#
# Exporting compiles one Core ML program per full-attention layer, per
# history variant, so it takes minutes per model and is skipped when the
# sidecar already exists. Verification is cheap and always runs: it compares the
# exported graph against an independent NumPy implementation of the same
# attention block, which is the check that a wrong geometry cannot pass.
