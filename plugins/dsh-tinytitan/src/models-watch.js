/**
 * Keep the route in step with `models/` while the harness is running.
 *
 * The route is written at boot, which is enough for a folder that does not
 * change during a session. Installing a model is a long download the person
 * starts and then wants to use, though, and deleting one is the other direction:
 * without this the picker keeps showing the folder as it was at boot, offering a
 * model that is gone and hiding one that is now there.
 *
 * A refresh is cheap (one process, one file write, and `settings.yaml` is
 * hot-reloaded) but an install is not one event -- thousands of files land in
 * the directory -- so changes are coalesced into one refresh per quiet period.
 *
 * The watcher is deliberately unref'd and non-persistent: it must never be the
 * reason the harness cannot exit. Nothing here throws outward; a platform where
 * watching fails falls back to the boot-time refresh with a log line.
