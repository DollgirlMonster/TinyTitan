/**
 * `dsh-tinytitan` — the DeepSeek Harness side of running models from a local TinyTitan
 * server.
 *
 * It does two things, both at boot, both idempotent:
 *
 * 1. **Keeps the route current.** The harness's own `llm-pi-ai` adapter serves
 *    these models — there is no adapter here — and this checkout's
 *    `tools/dsh_route.sh` is the one place that turns the installed models into
 *    that route's block. Running it means the model picker follows `models/`
 *    instead of a copy someone typed once.
 * 2. **Mounts a compaction backend that does not think.** Compaction and session
 *    titles name no reasoning level, so they inherit the route's default; on a
 *    local thinking model that spends a summariser's own output cap on thinking
 *    and costs tens of seconds on every new session's title. The preset this
 *    plugin generates points that row at `dsh-tinytitan/backend`.
 *
 * Neither job patches the harness or replaces its adapter, so a harness upgrade
 * cannot desynchronise a copied protocol implementation — and when the two
 * upstream asks in this repository's `docs/dsh-upstream-asks.md` land, the second
 * job becomes unnecessary.
