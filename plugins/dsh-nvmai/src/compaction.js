/**
 * Force thinking off for the harness's auxiliary model calls.
 *
 * The harness marks compaction and session-title calls with a `purpose` and
 * names no reasoning level, so `dsh-llm` fills in the route's default — which on
 * a local thinking model means a summariser that thinks inside its own output
 * cap, and a title call that costs tens of seconds on every new session.
 *
 * A `dsh-llm-deepseek` route has the same behaviour built in
 * (`resolveThinking`: `purpose === "session-title"` returns
 * `{ thinking: "disabled" }`); this module is the equivalent for any route the
 * harness serves through pi-ai, and it does it without reimplementing the
 * compaction engine: `dsh-compaction-basic`'s `summarizeWithLlm` reads exactly
 * one thing off the context it is handed — `ctx.llm.stream` — so a context that
 * delegates everything and overrides that one member is enough, and the
 * instruction, the checkpoint envelope, the pricing and the retry policy all
 * stay the engine's.
